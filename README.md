## Auto-watering ðŸ’¦ and soil moisture monitoring system for plant pots.

This project is a simple and cheap way to keep your plants watered and healthy. 
It uses a soil moisture sensor (FC-28) to monitor the moisture level of the soil and a water pump to water the plant when the soil is too dry.
The system is controlled by an ESP32S3 board and can be powered by a battery or a USB power supply.

A water level sensor is used to check if the water tank is empty, and the system will send a notification to the user when the water level is low.

Also, the system can be controlled remotely through web interface or android app.

### Hardware
In real project we decided to build a 10x10x10 plant pot, and using a YL-69 sensor, a 5V water pump, a water level sensor, some RGB LEDs and a ESP32S3 board.

- ESP32S3 
- YL-69 soil moisture sensor
- 5V water pump
- Water level sensor
- RGB LEDs (Visualize the real-time weather forecast, like when the weather is sunny, the LEDs will turn yellow, 
when it's raining, the LEDs will turn blue or gray, and so on)
